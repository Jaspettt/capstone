Suppose that you have the following results of survey. Now it is necessary to analyze obtained survey by using Simple Random Sampling and Stratified Random Sampling. Recommended tool for using is MS Excel. 

(Ignore the fpc and the clustering in calculating the standard error.)

P.S.  when you are going to write your answer into answer sheet, please round up to 2 digits after floating point

1) Assume that you're going to do Simple Random Sampling (SRS) for above dataset. 

Compute a mean:  blank  blank  blank  blank  

P.S here you need to drag-and-drop digit-by-digit. For example, if your answer is 35.13 then you need to drag 3, then 5, then . and then 1 and 3

2) Compute a standard error for SRS:  blank  blank  blank  blank

3) Now compute 95% of confidence interval. Please note that t-value in this case is equal to 2.04

Upper limit for SRS:  blank  blank  blank  blank  blank

Lower limit for SRS:  blank  blank  blank  blank  blank

P.S You need to take rounded answers from 1st and 2nd questions 

Now for Stratified part

1) What is the value of Wh        blank  blank  blank  blank

2) Compute a mean:  blank  blank  blank  blank  

3) Compute a standard error for Stratified part:  blank  blank  blank  blank

4) Compute d-value:  blank  blank  blank  blank
Hint: d- value is a ratio of standard error for statified over standard error for SRS
5) Compute d-squared:  blank  blank  blank  blank
6) Compute Neff          blank  blank  blank  blank
P.S you need to take exact anwer from 5-th step rounded up to 2 digits after floating point.

Firstly it it necessary to normalize your dataset: Z = (x-mu)/std

Initial theta parameters is equal to zero. Learning rate is 0.01. Now, let's complete the following table:

Suppose that you have the following dataset, with 3 input features, and 1 output feature. You're going to apply Logistic Regression algorithm with regularization.

Firstly it is necessary to apply normaization with the following formula: Z = (X-mu)/std.

Initial theta parameters = 0. 

#Iterations, lambda, learning rate

Cost function (rounded up to 2 digis after floating point)

Optimal theta parameter

Indicate here maximum theta value (rounded up to 2 digis after floating point)

N=100, alpha = 1, lambda = 1

 blank  blank  blank  blank

 blank  blank  blank  blank

N=1000, alpha = 1, lambda = 10

 blank  blank  blank  blank

 blank  blank  blank  blank

N=10000, alpha = 2, lambda = 5

 blank  blank  blank  blank

 blank  blank  blank  blank


After 10.000 iterations, alpha = 2, lambda = 5  and by setting threshold = 0.5, what is the number of zeros in the first 10 rows of prediction:
